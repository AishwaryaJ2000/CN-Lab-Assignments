 <p><font color="black"><i>Vijayadashami (Sanskrit: विजयादशमी, romanize Vijayadaśamī), more commonly known as Dussehra,and also known as Dasara or Dashain, 
  is a major Hindu festival celebrated every year at the end of Durga Puja and Navaratri.It is observed on the tenth day of the month
 of Ashvin, the seventh in the Hindu lunisolar calendar.The festival typically falls in the Gregorian calendar months of September and October.
 Vijayadashami is observed for different reasons and celebrated differently in various parts of the Indian subcontinent.  
 In the southern, eastern, northeastern, and some northern states of India, Vijayadashami marks the end of Durga Puja, 
 commemorating goddess Durga's victory against the buffalo-demon Mahishasura to restore and protect dharma.
 In the northern, central, and western states, it marks the end of Ramlila and commemorates the deity Rama's victory 
 over the demon-king Ravana.Alternatively, it marks a reverence for one of the aspects of goddess Devi, such as Durga or Saraswati.
